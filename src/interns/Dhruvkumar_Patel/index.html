      <p> Learning is my motto.  I'm a quick self-learner and a team player. Things I don't know I tend to learn from others and evolve as a part of a team. I like challenges; Given a set of problems, I tried to find the best solution and won't rest until I get one. </p>
      <p>I want to gain hands-on experience in the software industry and contribute to real-world projects by applying my academic knowledge. I want to learn how experts approach problems and solve them. Want to gain more experience in the field of cloud computing and distributed systems.   </p>
      <p> I am open to working in any industry. I like to create different APIs with a single purpose. By creating a small-simple API, we can break a big-complex problem.</p>
